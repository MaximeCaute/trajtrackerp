Version 1.2
===========
- Record trajectory before t=0 (detectable movement) and for config.max_post_response_record_duration after making a response
  (this is important to get reliable speed calculation also at the ends of the trajectory)
- Added FINGER_LIFTED event
- Recording and exporting trial.duration
- Fixed the location of the resource directory: it's now called "trajtrackerp_res" and properly installed under site-packages

Version 1.1
===========

- Optionally allow short finger-off-screen periods during a trial (config.max_offscreen_duration)
- Changed distribution to wheel
